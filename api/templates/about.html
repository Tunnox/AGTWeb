        <p>The AGT Web App is a secure digital platform developed for Amazing Grace Tabernacle, Sheffield. It has been designed to help members, leaders, and administrators collect, store, and access church records in a structured, responsible, and transparent way. Through the app, users are able to connect with one another, share information safely, manage church activities more efficiently, and ensure that all data is handled fairly and securely.</p>
      <br>
        <p><strong>How to Use the App</strong></p>
        <p>Members can log in to the app to update and manage their personal information, register their attendance at services and events, access sermons, teaching materials, and other resources online, submit prayer requests, or join community groups. They can also receive secure announcements and communications directly through the platform. 
Leaders and administrators have additional features available to them. They can manage the membership database through a secure, centralized system, schedule and track events and activities, oversee donations and giving records, and communicate safely with members and leaders. The system also supports transparency and accountability by ensuring that data management is carried out responsibly. </p>
        <p><strong>Benefits of Using the App</strong></p>
        <p>For the wider church community, the AGT Web App offers several important benefits. It strengthens the connection between members, leaders, and groups, while ensuring compliance with UK GDPR regulations. The platform ensures that all data is handled responsibly, with transparency and consent at the forefront. It also protects information through encryption, role-based access controls, and regular audits. Most importantly, it builds trust through the responsible stewardship of both personal and financial data.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Our Policies</strong></p>
        <p>The AGT Web App is built on strong policies of data protection and transparency. In line with UK GDPR, all personal data is processed lawfully, fairly, and openly. Consent and stewardship are central principles: members are always informed about how their data is used, and no information is shared without permission. Access to sensitive records is strictly role-based, meaning only authorized personnel can reach them. Furthermore, accountability is ensured through oversight by the AGT Admin Centre, which supervises the management of all church data.</p>

        <p><strong>Best Practices</strong></p>
        <p>To help ensure security, users are encouraged to adopt best practices. This includes using strong and unique passwords, keeping personal details up to date, and never sharing login credentials with others. Members should also report any suspicious or incorrect data immediately and communicate respectfully and with integrity when engaging in community groups.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Data Protection and security</strong></p>
        <p> The AGT Web App guarantees that all records are securely encrypted and backed up. Access is carefully controlled through roles such as Admin, Leader, Member, and Guest. Regular audits and monitoring are carried out to ensure full compliance with policies and regulations. In addition, procedures are in place for a rapid response in the event of errors or breaches, ensuring that risks are minimized and trust is preserved. </p>
