        <h3>Our Policies</h3>
        <p>The AGT Web App is built on strong policies of data protection and transparency. In line with UK GDPR, all personal data is processed lawfully, fairly, and openly. Consent and stewardship are central principles: members are always informed about how their data is used, and no information is shared without permission. Access to sensitive records is strictly role-based, meaning only authorized personnel can reach them. Furthermore, accountability is ensured through oversight by the AGT Admin Centre, which supervises the management of all church data.

Members should also report any suspicious or incorrect data immediately and communicate respectfully and with integrity when engaging in community groups.</p>
